/**
 * A view animation step describes the changes applied to a view during an animation step (HLSAnimationStep). An 
 * animation step is the combination of several view animation steps (HLSViewAnimationStep) applied to a set of views, and 
 * represent the collective set of changes applied to these views during some time interval. An animation (HLSAnimation) 
 * is then simply a collection of animation steps.
 *
 * Designated initializer: init (create a view animation step with default settings)
