/**
 * We often need to manage a stack of view controllers. Usually, we use a navigation controller, but there is no way
 * to use other transition animations as the built-in ones. Sometimes, we also want to show view controllers
 * modally, but often the usual presentModalViewController:animated: method of UIViewController is too limited (modal
 * sheets on the iPad have pre-defined sizes, and when displaying full screen the view below disappears, which prevents
 * from displaying transparent modal windows).
 *
 * To circumvent those problems, HLSStackController provides a generic way to deal with a view controller stack. It can
 * be applied a richer set of transition animations. HLSStackController is not meant to be subclassed.
 *
 * This view controller container guarantees correct view lifecycle and rotation event propagation to the view controllers
 * it manages. Note that when a view controller gets pushed onto the stack, the view controller below will get the
 * viewWillDisappear: and viewDidDisappear: events, even if it stays visible through transparency (the same holds for
 * the viewWillAppear: and viewDidAppear: events when the view controller on top gets popped).
 * This decision was made because it would have been extremely difficult and costly to look at all view controller's 
 * views in the stack to find those which are really visible (this would have required to find the intersections of all 
 * view and subview rectangles, cumulating alphas to find which parts of the view stack are visible and which aren't;
 * clearly not worth it).
 *
 * When a view controller's view is inserted into a stack controller, its view frame is automatically adjusted to match 
 * the container view bounds, as for usual UIKit containers (UITabBarController, UINavigationController). Be sure that
 * the view controller's view size and autoresizing behaviors are correctly set.
 *
 * HLSStackController uses the smoother 1-step rotation available from iOS3. You cannot use the 2-step rotation for view 
 * controllers you pushed in it (it will be ignored, see UIViewController documentation). The 2-step rotation is deprecated 
 * starting with iOS 5, you should not use it anymore anyway.
 *
 * Since a stack controller can manage many view controller's views, and since in general only the first few top ones
 * need to be visible, it would be a waste of resources to keep all views loaded at any time. At creation time, the
 * maximal number of loaded view controllers ("capacity") can be provided. By default, the capacity is set to 2, 
 * which means that the container guarantees that at most the two top view controller's views are loaded. The 
 * controller simply unloads the view controller's views below in the stack so save memory. Usually, the default value
 * should fulfill most needs, but if you require more transparency levels or if you want to minimize load / unload
 * operations, you can increase this value. Standard capacity values are provided at the beginning of this file.
 *
 * TODO: This class currently does not support view controllers implementing the HLSOrientationCloner protocol
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithRootViewController:capacity:
