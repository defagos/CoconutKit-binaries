/**
 * Raw view controller class adding useful stuff to UIViewController:
 *   - localization is isolated in a single method. This is not only convenient to have a single place for localization code, 
 *     but this also makes HLSViewController compatible with the NSBundle+HLSDynamicLocalization.h class extension, making
 *     it possible to change a view controller localization at runtime (if this is not needed, HLSViewController of course
 *     remains compatible with the usual way of changing localization via system preferences)
 *   - view cleanup and general cleanup are separated
 *   - overriding methods is cleaner: The rule is now "Always call the super implementation first" (the behavior is otherwise
 *     undefined)
 *
 * This class is not meant to be instantiated directly, you should subclass it to define your own view controllers.
 *
 * If your subclass overrides any of the view lifecycle events methods (viewWill..., viewDid...), be sure to call the super
 * method first, otherwise the behavior is undefined. The same holds for view orientation events and for the -localize
 * method.
 *
 * There is only one major difference with UIViewController. For UIViewController, shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:
 * returns YES only for portrait orientations when not overridden. This creates an exception to the rule that subclasses
 * should call the super view event and orientation methods first. This is confusing and ugly, especially for view controllers
 * picked from a library (in such cases, super has to be called or not depending on the view controller's implementation).
 * If you are lucky, the documentation of a view controller will explicitly state what sublcasses must do, but I think it is
 * best to stick to a single rule, namely to always begin by calling the super implementation. To fix this inconsistency,
 * HLSViewController returns YES for all orientations. Then, If a view controller inherits from HLSViewController (either
 * directly or indirectly), its implementation of shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: (if overridden) must always
 * always begin with:
 *   if (! [super shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:toInterfaceOrientation]) {
 *      return NO;
 *   }
 *   // Rest of the implementation here
 *
 * This class also provides a way to debug view controller events (lifecycle, rotation, memory warnings). You must
 * set the logger level of your application to DEBUG (see HLSLogger.h to know how this is achieved). Then use the 
 * console when running your application to have a look at view controller events.
 *
 * Designated initializer: initWithNibName:bundle:

/**
 * Override this method in your subclass and release all views retained by the view controller in its implementation. This method 
 * gets called automatically when deallocating or receiving a viewDidUnload event. This allows to cleanly separate the object releasing
 * code of a view controller into two blocks:
 *   - in releaseViews: Release all views created when loading the view, and retained by the view controller. If your view controller 
 *     subclass retains view controllers to avoid creating their views too often ("view caching"), also set the views of thesee view 
 *     controllers to nil in this method. If you are subclassing a class already subclassing HLSViewController, always send the releaseView 
 *     message to super first.
 *   - in dealloc: Release all other resources owned by the view controller (model objects, other view controllers, views
 *     existing before the view is loaded, etc.)

/**
 * In your subclass, use this method to collect your localization code. You must not call this method directly, it is automatically
 * called when needed. The method body itself should not contain any logic, only localization code (e.g. setting outlets using
 * NSLocalizedString macros, reloading table views containing localized strings, etc.)
 * When overriding the method, be sure to call the super method first, otherwise the behavior is undefined
 *
 * To ensure that your application is properly localized - even when the localization changes at runtime using +[NSBundle setLocalization:]
 * (from NSBundle+HLSDynamicLocalization.h) - you must access localized resources only from within this method.
