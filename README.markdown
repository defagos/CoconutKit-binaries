**Do not watch, clone or fork this repository**

This repository contains tagged binaries for CoconutKit (https://github.com/defagos/CoconutKit) which are only meant for use by CocoaPods 0.5.1 and above (https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods). CocoaPods namely currently only supports the git: protocol, which is why this repository was required.

This repository will be useless when CocoaPods 0.6 is made available, at which point binaries will directly be downloaded from the CoconutKit project download page over HTTP.
